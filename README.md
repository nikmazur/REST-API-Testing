# REST-API-Testing
This project emulates a simple REST server and unit tests for it.

For the REST web server part I used Spring Boot and this short tutorial:
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

The server part can be run from the main class for manual testing (for example from Postman).

Tests were written with TestNG as the testing framework and REST Assured for managing requests and responses to the server.
